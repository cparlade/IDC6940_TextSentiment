    "text": "Introduction\nThe introduction should:\n\nDevelop a storyline that captures attention and maintains interest.\nYour audience is your peers\nClearly state the problem or question you’re addressing.\n\nToday’s markets move nearly instantaneously to news headlines. A single Bloomberg article or tweet can push a mega-cap’s share price by hundreds of billions before most humans can finish reading it. For data-driven traders, headline sentiment is therefore a first-line signal that is used to track order flow, flag risk, and populate real-time dashboards. The question is which sentiment engine to trust: a lightweight rule-based lexicon written in 2014, or a 110 million- parameter transformer fine-tuned last night?"

Here \\(m(x)\\) is unknown and \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) some errors. With the help of this definition, we can create the estimation for local averaging i.e. \\(m(x)\\) can be estimated with the product of \\(Y_i\\) average and \\(X_i\\) is near to \\(x\\). In other words, this means that we are discovering the line through the data points with the help of surrounding data points. The estimation formula is printed below (R Core Team 2019):\n\\[\nM_n(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} W_n (X_i) Y_i  \\tag{1}\n\\]\\(W_n(x)\\) is the sum of weights that belongs to all real numbers. Weights are positive numbers and small if \\(X_i\\) is far from \\(x\\).\nAnother equation:\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 +\\varepsilon_i\n\\]"
